    <p>Programming a Saturday night (as you will see, a somewhat boring Saturday), already lowering the brightness and setting the orange filter to the maximum on my MacBook to have less "impact" of the blue light to consolidate my sleep I remembered these "Amazon Kindles" reading devices and I thought... What if there was a screen or a filter that simulates these screens as much as possible? This boring in black and white and with little brightness to be able to continue working or doing my things but at the same time allow me to consolidate my dream?</p>

    <p>So I talk to my friend ChatGPT and I got down to work to create this filter, in less than 24 hours it's ready and I use it daily at night.</p>

    <p>And does it work to consolidate sleep while we work? Clear! Seeing in black and white makes us bored as we don't have "attention triggers" to wake us up but at the same time it allows us to work on those boring things we do.</p>
    <p>I hope this helps you.</p>
